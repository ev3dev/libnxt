Description: utility library for talking to the LEGO Mindstorms NXT brick
 LibNXT is an utility library for talking to the LEGO Mindstorms NXT intelligent
 brick at a relatively low level. It currently does:
  * Handling USB communication and locating the NXT in the USB tree.
  * Interaction with the Atmel AT91SAM boot assistant.
  * Flashing of a firmware image to the NXT.
  * Execution of code directly in RAM.
 .
 The design of LibNXT is layered, meaning you can plug into it at any level of
 complexityor abstraction you desire, from the lowest level USB bulk bit-pushing
 interface, to an API exposing the SAM-BA commandset, right up to just calling
 nxt_firmware_flash() and having everything taken care of!
 .
 This package provides two binary utils:
  * fwflash is the program that uses LibNXT. As its name hints, its purpose is
    to take a NXT firmware image file and flash it to a connected NXT device.
  * fwexec is another utility, which takes a specially compiled firmware image,
   uploads it to the NXT's RAM, and executes it directly from there.
